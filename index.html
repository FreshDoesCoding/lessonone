      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p class="bio">
        Hi, my name is Gustavo, and I love to workout at the gym, go to the
        beach when it's sunny and go out often to enjoy myself. Born and raised
        in San Diego, I've always been fascinated by the way things work in a
        website and now I get the opportunity to make this into a career that I
        can love.

      <p class="bio">
        The reason I'm taking this course is because I want to improve my HTML
        and CSS skills more to the point where I can fully be comfortable with
        it and know what's mostly going on in every project out there when it
        comes to looking at HTML and CSS code. I hope to gain new knowledge of
        things in this course and improve my flaws every time I use HTML and CSS
        code.
      </p>

        Before I decided on a career before college began, my previous
        experience I had was using photoshop to make thumbnails for YouTube
        videos, video editing using premiere pro (Now I use Cap cut and
        sometimes Davinci for quick editing). And lastly, I had experience using
        FL Studio to make music and I kind of still do still use it but I'm more
        focused on making web applications now than what I did before.
